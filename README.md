Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown's tools for using scanning transmission electron microscopy holography (STEMH) techniques to quickly acquire the phase of specimens measured through 4D-STEM. We optimize the computation time by exploiting the raw data's structure as a sparse array.

main uses Levi's code for optimally managing the data, but the frontier branch has the newest working code from Andrew to compute phases.
