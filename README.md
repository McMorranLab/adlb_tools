# adlb_tools

Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown's tools for using scanning transmission electron microscopy holography (STEMH) techniques to quickly acquire the phase of specimens measured through 4D-STEM. We optimize the computation time by exploiting the raw data's structure as a sparse array.

main, fft_tools, and frame_analysis use Levi's code for optimally managing the data, but stemh_tools and stemh_analysis has the newest working code from Andrew to compute phases.
