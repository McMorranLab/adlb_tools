Andrew Ducharme and Levi Brown's tools for using scanning transmission electron microscopy holography (STEMH) techniques to quickly acquire the phase of specimens measured through 4D-STEM. We optimize the computation time by exploiting the raw data's structure as a sparse array.

main uses code optimized by Levi, but the frontier branch has the newest working code from Andrewâ€“it just might take a few minutes to run.
